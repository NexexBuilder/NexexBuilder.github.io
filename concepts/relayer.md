# Relayer

> A relayer is any party or entity which hosts an off-chain orderbook. They provide a way for users to add, remove and update this orderbook through an API, GUI or both. In doing so, relayers help traders discover counter-parties and ferry cryptographically signed orders between them. Once two parties agree on the terms of an order, the order is settled directly on the Ethereum blockchain via the 0x protocol smart contracts. \(from 0x protocol's wiki\)

In Nexex, We share the same idea of relayer, and furthermore we guaruntee both relayer who connect the maker and relayer who connect the taker will all be rewarded for their efforts. 

By rewarding both relayers, we unify relayers' best interest to sharing orders rather than holding them. And relayers can focus on connecting more users into the platform.
