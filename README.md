# Overview

Nexex is a research purpose, next generation decentralized exchange toolkit. It allows anyone to become a relayer, publish and receive any interested orders from other relayers.

## Why Nexex?

Nexex highly values relayers' contribution to the ecosystem, more than any other DEX solutions in the market. We consider the current market is fragmented, while more DEX appear, end user's trading intentions are trapped in more platforms and make it harder to get them matched. This harms the whole industry. 

So we build Nexex toolkit with several core features

1. Everyone can become a relayer, and all relayers are connected via a decentralized message channel.
2. When an order is taken by order taker, both the relayer who helped order maker to publish and distributed the order and the relayer who helped taker to trade this order will be awarded for their contributions.
3. the orderbook service we provide is designed to be able to configure to scale out for different needs.
